# My interactive CV

- Project Description:
  Intern Induction Training Assignment.
  Your challenge is to create a website version of a CV that tells us about yourself, your skills
  and what are some of your hobbies.
  The CV needs to be hosted on a hosting platform (it must not just run from your machine)
  One of the requirements is to have a `Contact Me` section on your site. The details entered by
  a user must be saved in a database that can be viewed from an admin perspective and this
  update or entry must happen in real time.

## A couple of criteria that will be used:

- Usage of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please try not to use frameworks unless necessary, which is never.
- The site must be responsive. It must be able to render on multiple devices properly. Flex
  and media queries are your big
- Your contact details information must be saved to a database so we can view and see
  every entry into the `Contact Me` section
